During my research on portfolio blog sites, I came across a reading progress bar that is placed at the top of the page to indicate how much of the post is left to read.\n\nThis progress bar is a good way to know how much content is remaining and it provides feedback to the user, potentially improving the user experience of the website.\n\n![gif-preview-progressbar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biplobsd/biplobsd.github.io/data/images/reading-progressbar/reading_progress_bar.gif)\n\nI found a tutorial by Anshuman Bhardwaj that explains how to implement a reading progress bar in a React and TailwindCSS project. Since my site is built with NextJS and TailwindCSS, I was able to adapt the tutorial to suit my website.\n\nhttps://theanshuman.dev/articles/creating-a-read-progress-bar-in-react-and-tailwindcss-g1n\n\nLet's see how to create a reading progress bar like the one on my website.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nIf you want to access the full source code for this project, you can find it on the tutorial's below source code section.\n\n## Create a Hook File in Your NextJS Project\n\n![useReadingProgressbar.ts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biplobsd/biplobsd.github.io/data/images/reading-progressbar/useReadingProgressbar.png)\n\nCopy this code snippet below and save it as `useReadingProgressbar.ts` file.\n\n## Code snippet\n\n```typescript\nimport { useEffect, useState } from \"react\";\nimport { useRouter } from \"next/router\";\n\n/**\n * React Hook to get the scroll percentage from the page, returns value from 0 to 100\n */\nexport function useReadingProgress() {\n  const [completion, setCompletion] = useState(0);\n  const router = useRouter();\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    function updateScrollCompletion() {\n      // see how much we have scrolled\n      const currentProgress = window.scrollY;\n      // see how much total scroll is available\n      const scrollHeight = document.body.scrollHeight - window.innerHeight;\n      if (scrollHeight) {\n        setCompletion(\n          Number((currentProgress / scrollHeight).toFixed(2)) * 100\n        );\n      }\n    }\n\n    function handleRouteChange() {\n      setCompletion(0); // Reset completion when the route changes\n    }\n\n    // Add scroll and route change event listeners\n    window.addEventListener(\"scroll\", updateScrollCompletion);\n    router.events.on(\"routeChangeStart\", handleRouteChange);\n\n    // Remove event listeners on unmount\n    return () => {\n      window.removeEventListener(\"scroll\", updateScrollCompletion);\n      router.events.off(\"routeChangeStart\", handleRouteChange);\n    };\n  }, [router]);\n\n  return completion;\n}\n```\n\nThis code snippet was obtained from Anshuman Bhardwaj's blog post. I have added an additional NextJS router event to reset the completion to 0 when the page changes. This ensures that the reading progress bar will be updated when a user visits another blog post.\n\n## Styling\n\n```typescript\nimport { useReadingProgress } from \"~/hooks/useReadingProgressbar\";\n\nexport default function Header() {\n  const completion = useReadingProgress();\n\n  return (\n    <header\n      style={{\n        backgroundSize: `${completion}%`,\n        backgroundRepeat: \"no-repeat\",\n      }}\n      className=\"sticky top-0 h-14 w-full bg-gradient-to-r from-red-500/30 from-30% to-blue-500/50 to-100% backdrop-blur-sm transition-all duration-500 ease-in-out \"\n    >\n      <div className=\"text-center text-white\">Header</div>\n    </header>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nI have used a TailwindCSS gradient and adjusted the `backgroundSize` CSS property to reflect the completion percentage. This also supports the transition utility for smooth animations.\n\n## Preview\n\n![Preview tutorial project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biplobsd/biplobsd.github.io/data/images/reading-progressbar/source-code-project-preview.gif)\n\n## Source Code\n\nYou can find the source code for this tutorial on https://github.com/biplobsd/reading-progress-bar\n\nYou can also see the implementation of this reading progress bar on the PNP website, which is an open-source project.\n\nhttps://github.com/SpeedOut-Source/pnp/blob/82093fda9ce75e7d63c82bd378d8b77a7a08ef79/src/components/header/header.tsx#L49C7-L61C8\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThat's it!
