The app is built using Flutter and uses the Stellar Horizon API to collect account information, which is parsed locally in the user's browser.\n\n## Problem\n\nThe client had a requirement to build a tool that could help Stellar users easily check their account information and asset holder limits. The client wanted a tool that would be easy to use and provide users with a native app experience.\n\n## Solution\n\nThe development team proposed building a PWA app that would use the Stellar Horizon API to collect account information. They chose to use Flutter for the frontend to provide a native app experience for users. The team decided to host the app on Amazon S3 buckets.\n\n## Features\n\n- Check account information: Users can check their account information by entering their account public key.\n- Filter check: Users can filter account information by asset code, issuer address, and balance limit.\n- Single/Multi checker: Users can check a single account or multiple accounts at once.\n- Asset holder checker: Users can check their asset holder limits.\n- History: Users can view their search history.\n- Export data as CSV: Users can export their account information as a CSV file.\n- Dark and light theme: Users can choose between dark and light themes.\n- PWA app: The app can be installed on a user's device and used offline.\n\n## Team\n\n- Jose Urquiza, <a href='https://twitter.com/@hollowvox'>@hollowvox</a>: Funned, Manager\n- Biplob Kumar Sutradhar, <a href='https://twitter.com/@biplobsd11'>@biplobsd11</a>: Lead Developer\n- Arnob dey, <a href='https://twitter.com/@arnob_016'>@arnob_016</a>: Design, client requirement sync\n- Mahian Islam Sadim, <a href='https://github.com/MahianSadim'>@MahianSadim</a>: Tester\n\n## Results\n\nThe development team was able to deliver the Action Wallet Checker tool to the client. The tool has been well received by users and has received positive feedback for its ease of use and native app experience. The app has also been able to handle a large number of requests without any issues.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Action Wallet Checker is a successful project that has met the client's requirements and provided users with an easy-to-use tool for checking their Stellar account information and asset holder limits. The use of Flutter for the frontend and hosting the app on Amazon S3 buckets has allowed the app to provide a native app experience for users and handle a large number of requests.\n","itemView":{"imgUrl":"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43641536/230180140-a0552cd5-3823-409e-92a9-fe33d5082d13.gif","app":{"name":"Action wallet checker","logoUrl":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biplobsd/biplobsd.github.io/data/images/awc-logo.png"},"company":{"name":"Action Tokens","logoUrl":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biplobsd/biplobsd.github.io/data/images/logos/action-tokens.png"},"whatText":"Stellar Account Checker and Asset Holder Limit Tool.","result":"This tool was well-received by users and delivered a native app experience, meeting the client's requirements.","date":1680541759736,"readTime":2,"fileName":"Action wallet checker.md","imgBlurData":"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAQAAAADCAIAAAA7ljmRAAAACXBIWXMAAAPoAAAD6AG1e1JrAAAAMklEQVR4nAEnANj/ABEADLO2wuXm82hgaQC7vcjDws7R0NyXk54Av7/L5ebz1NXi6+76s8IZdYj515UAAAAASUVORK5CYII="},"previous":{"imgUrl":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biplobsd/biplobsd.github.io/data/images/stellar-wall-preview.png","app":{"name":"Stellar Wall","logoUrl":"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43641536/232205018-85cb74eb-e216-43ee-be64-fc06130057a5.png"},"company":{"name":"Nuna Project Art","logoUrl":"https://nunaproject.art/assets/img/logo/logo.png"},"whatText":"Stellar Wall is a 100x100 pixels online billboard that offers advertise your projects.","result":"User able to share to their NFT collections, assets, projects by showing any picture on their pixels.","date":1681635550000,"readTime":2,"fileName":"stellar-wall.md","imgBlurData":"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAQAAAACCAIAAADwyuo0AAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAAJUlEQVR4nAEaAOX/AFZTaJybqLm5xfLy/wARCiadnKvAwMvR0d+2GQ78O2L+kQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=="},"next":null,"type":"projects","more4":null},"__N_SSG":true}
