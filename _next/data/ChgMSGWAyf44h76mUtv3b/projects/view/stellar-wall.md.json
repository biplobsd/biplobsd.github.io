It is built with Flutter web and uses Firebase as its database service. The primary problem was how to display all the blocks on the webpage in an interactive way, allowing users to move view block information with a click or hover. The client had a limited budget, and the project required a cost-efficient full-stack solution. The website's design was based on Material Design and aimed to provide a native experience. Stellar Wall has several features that make it stand out, including the ability to share images to the homepage, view blocks interactively, share GIFs and APNGs.\n\n## Problem\n\n- The primary problem was how to display all the blocks on the webpage in an interactive way.\n- The client wanted users to be able to move view block information with a click or hover.\n- The client had a limited budget, requiring a cost-efficient full-stack solution.\n- The website needed to be user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing.\n\n## Solution\n\nAfter thorough research, our team decided to use Flutter Web for the frontend, Django REST API for the backend, and Firebase Firestore for the database.
