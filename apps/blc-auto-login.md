Automatically log in to the BLC website without manually entering your username and password.

## Features

- Toggle on/off
- Auto login account
- Dark theme
- Open-source

## Usages

To get started, simply click the toggle button to turn it on. Then enter your BLC login credentials. And you're all set. From now on, whenever you visit the https://elearn.daffodilvarsity.edu.bd/ page, if you're not already logged in, this extension will automatically input your username and password in the login section and attempt to log you in. If you're already logged in, the extension won't take any action.

if you need more feature on this app, highly requested to create an issue on our GitHub repository https://github.com/biplobsd/blc-auto-login/issues tab.
