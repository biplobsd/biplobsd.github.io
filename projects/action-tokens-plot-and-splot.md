# Action Tokens Plot and SPlot - Grid for placing images into blocks

<a href="https://map.action-tokens.com">Live at map.action-tokens.com</a>

## Overview

Action Tokens Plot and SPlot is a website where action token holders can place images into their plots and SPlots and view their plot's location on a grid interface. This website is built with the Next.js framework.

## Problem

The main problem is finding a way to visualize all plots and SPlots on one screen in a more interactive manner. Users should easily be able to identify the location of their plots and upload their artwork images into them.

## Solution

My SpeedOut team and I designed and researched a solution. We came up with a simple grid-based approach to display all the plots on the website screen. We chose Next.js, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, Zustand, Firebase, and Amplify to solve this problem with the website.

## Design

The design of Action Tokens Plot and SPlot was based on the client's requirements and ideas. Our initial design was created using Figma. We went through several iterations before finalizing the website's design.

### Initial Figma design

#### Figma map view screen design
