# Action Tokens Gallery - Image Sharing Website

<a href="https://gallery.action-tokens.com/">Live at gallery.action-tokens.com</a>

## Overview

Action Tokens Gallery is a website built with Next.js and Firebase as its database service, that allows users to share their images and showcase their art. The main focus of the website is to provide a simple, fast, and user-friendly UI to users. The objective was to create a cost-efficient full-stack solution with minimal clicks to find information on the website.

## Problem

The main challenge was to create a user-friendly UI that would enable users to upload their images quickly. The UI had to be simple and straightforward, making it easy for users to navigate the website. The cost was another important factor to consider while designing the website.

## Solution

After conducting thorough research, our team chose

- Next.JS as framework
- TailwindCSS for frontend
- Firebase Firestore for backend database
- Amazon Amplifier was used as the Next.JS hosting

## Design

The website's design was based on the client's requirements and ideas. We began by creating initial drawings on paper and went through several iterations before finalizing the website's design. We focused on creating a minimalist, user-friendly UI that would require fewer clicks to find information. We used TailwindCSS to achieve this design.
