## Case Study

Action Wallet Checker - Stellar Account Checker and Asset Holder Limit Tool.

## Overview

Action Wallet Checker is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that allows users to check their Stellar account information and asset holder limits. The app is built using Flutter and uses the Stellar Horizon API to collect account information, which is parsed locally in the user's browser.

## Problem

The client had a requirement to build a tool that could help Stellar users easily check their account information and asset holder limits. The client wanted a tool that would be easy to use and provide users with a native app experience.

## Solution

The development team proposed building a PWA app that would use the Stellar Horizon API to collect account information. They chose to use Flutter for the frontend to provide a native app experience for users. The team decided to host the app on Amazon S3 buckets.

## Features

- Check account information: Users can check their account information by entering their account public key.
- Filter check: Users can filter account information by asset code, issuer address, and balance limit.
- Single/Multi checker: Users can check a single account or multiple accounts at once.

- History: Users can view their search history.
- Export data as CSV: Users can export their account information as a CSV file.
- Dark and light theme: Users can choose between dark and light themes.
- PWA app: The app can be installed on a user's device and used offline.
