## Case Study

Action Wallet Checker - Stellar Account Checker and Asset Holder Limit Tool.

## Overview

Action Wallet Checker is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that allows users to check their Stellar account information and asset holder limits. The app is built using Flutter and uses the Stellar Horizon API to collect account information, which is parsed locally in the user's browser.

## Problem

## Solution
